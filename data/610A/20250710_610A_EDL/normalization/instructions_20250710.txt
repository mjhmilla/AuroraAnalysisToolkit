1. Using the dial, manually stretch specimen until it develops some passive force. Write down dial position X-10
2. Run normalization_01_isometric.dpf and write down the maximum force (f0)
3. Using the dial, manually make the specimen slack by at least 10mm. Write down dial position X-10 Run normalization_02_motorTo10mm.dpf
4. Using the dial, manually stretch specimen (using the dial) until it passively develops 0.5 f0. Write down dial position.
5. Run normalization_03_activeForceLength.dpf, and record
  a. lref: specimen length at at fmax.
  b. lzero: extrapolated length at which the active force is zero.
  c. lceOpt, where 0.6*lceOpt = lzero-lref
6. Adjust:
  a. Machine: Using the dial, manually adjust end so that the specimen has a length of lref at a motor position of 0. 
7. Run normalization_04_isometricForce.dpf, and record
  a. Record fmax
8. Measure lpeHalf, the distance from lref at which fpe = 1/2 fmax
  a. Note current manual length setting.
  b. Using the dial, manually stretch specimen until it passively develops 0.5 fmax
  c. Record lpeHalf
  d. Using the dial, manually return the length to lref using the dial
9. Run normalization_05_forceVelocity_EDL.dpf or normalization_05_forceVelocity_SOL.dpf, and record
  a. vmax in mm/s
10. Update:
  a. normalization/metaData_20250710.csv
  b. main_generateProjectMimeProtocols610A.m
  c. Using main_generateProjectMimeProtocols610A.m generate new protocol
11. Run updated normalization_07_impedance.dpf
Note: Save all generated data files using the same name as the dpf file but with the extension of ddf (the usual data file extension)
